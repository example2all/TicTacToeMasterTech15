# Link to your Card
If you are here you must have completed the exercise and have a working Tic Tac Toe game. You can push your Tic Tac Toe branch up and submit a pull request.

The three files you worked on (e.g. jdTicTacToe.html, jdstyles.css, jdscript.js) will be copied from the TicTacToe local repository over to the [team website](https://github.com/TechCohort15/GitTechWebsite15) local repository. There are several steps to take:

1. Before you get started make sure to create a new branch in your destination repository (team website: GitTechWebsite15).   
2. Branch name will be yourinitialsCardLink (e.g. Jane Doe's = **jdCardLink**)
3. Checkout the new branch
4. Copy over the files you worked on (e.g. jdTicTacToe.html, jdstyles.css, jdscript.js) from source repository (TicTacToe) to destination (GitTechWebsite15)
5. On the index.html page inside GitTechWebsite15 modify Contact button on your card to be a link to your html page:

 ```js
 <p><button class="button">Contact</button></p>
```
Try to figure this one out. The button should read "My Project" and be a simple link to your newly created html page that has your Tic Tac Toe game. When someone click on the "My Project" button they will navigate to your game. 

Once you are done make sure to push your branch up to GitTechWebsite15 and submit a pull request. 

Ask someone to review your pull request for approval. 

The goal is to have everyone's Tic Tac Toe game linked on the main page.
